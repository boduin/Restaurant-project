                <p>Chicken biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish that originates from the Indian subcontinent. It features marinated chicken pieces, typically cooked with a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, cardamom, and saffron, which infuse the rice with rich aromas. The chicken is often seared before being layered with partially cooked basmati rice, creating a perfect balance of tender meat and fluffy grains.
    
                    Traditionally, biryani is cooked using the "dum" method, where the pot is sealed to trap steam, allowing the flavors to meld together beautifully. It’s usually garnished with fried onions, fresh cilantro, and boiled eggs, and served with raita (a yogurt-based side) or salad. Chicken biryani is loved for its depth of flavor, making it a favorite choice for festive occasions and everyday meals alike.</p>
